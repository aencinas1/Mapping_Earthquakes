# Mapping Earthquakes
In this challenge, we elaborate on the earthquake work done in the module. To our earthquake map, I added a techtonic plate layer to visualize plate separation and how it relates to earthquakes. I then added another overlay layer to only show large earthquakes. Finally, I added another map tile for an alternative view to make viewing my map easier.
